# RECURSIVE

Recursive is a minecraft modpack "designed" to be as vanilla friendly while still adding features that others may or may not enjoy using. By proxy, it is also perfectly capable of being used as a baseline for other modpacks.

## FAQ

#### "Isnt this just hosted on modrinth?"

Yep! It is! This github repo serves as a way of tracking what actually changes in the .mrpack used to install the modpack, both for my sake so i know what im actually editing, and just incase anyone is actually curious as to exactly just what files are in the modpack?

#### "Will this run on my system?"

I have absolutely **NO** idea if it will! This isn't the place for asking that! Though, it runs on my steamdeck with very minimal hitches if thats *any* way to judge the modpacks performance!
